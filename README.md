``Working with Data Collections ``
We will need to create two different data processing algorithms and will involve:
1. Transforming raw data into a formatted array of objects
2. Using the output from the first step to provide a textual report on the data. 

Objectives
Use arrays to store ordered lists of data.
Use objects to store keyed lists of data.
Use conditional logic to process data.
Use loops to handle repetitive tasks. 
Transform data according to specifications.
